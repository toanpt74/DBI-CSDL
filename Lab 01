Giving a database schema: 
-	Sailors(sid: integer, sname: string, rating: integer, age:real)
-	Boats(bid:integer , bname: string, color: string)
-	Reserves(sid: integer, bid: integer , day: date )
Using relational algebra expression to answer below queries
1.	Find the names of sailors who have reserved boat 103

 <Sname> ( <Bid=103> ((Sailors ⋈<sid=sid> Reservers) ⋈<Bid=Bid>Boats)))

2.	Find the names of sailors who have reserved a red boat

<Sname>(<Color=red> ((Sailors ⋈<sid=sid> Reservers)⋈<Bid=Bid>Boats)))

3.	Find the colors of boats reserved by Lubber.

 <color>(  <sName=Lubber>  ((Sailors ⋈<sid=sid> Reservers) ⋈<Bid=Bid>Boats)))


4.	Find the names of sailors who have reserved at least one boat.

 <sName>( ( <Sid>( Sailors)   <Sid>( Reserves)) ⋈<Sid=Sid>( Sailors))

5.	Find the names of sailors who have reserved a red or a green boat

R1 = <Sname>(<Color=red ((Sailors ⋈<sid=sid> Reservers)⋈<Bid=Bid>Boats)))
R2 = <Sname>(<Color=Green ((Sailors ⋈<sid=sid> Reservers)⋈<Bid=Bid>Boats)))
	R = R1  R1
6.	Find the names of sailors who have reserved a red and a green boat

R1 = <Sname>(<Color=red ((Sailors ⋈<sid=sid> Reservers)⋈<Bid=Bid>Boats)))
R2 = <Sname>(<Color=Green ((Sailors ⋈<sid=sid> Reservers)⋈<Bid=Bid>Boats)))
	R = R1  R1

7.	Find the sids of sailors with age over 20 who have not reserved a red boat
TH1:
R1 = <Sid>(<age>=20>( sailors))
R2 = <Sid>(<color !=red> (Reservers ⋈<Bid=Bid> Boats))
R = R1  R2
	TH2:
(<Sid>(<age>=20>( sailors))) ⋈<Sid=Sid> (<Sid>(<color !=red> (Reservers ⋈<Bid=Bid> Boats)))  

8.	Find the names of sailors who have reserved all boats
Select s.sname, count(s.sid) as c from Sailors s 
Join Reserves r on s.sid = r.sid
Group by s.sname HAVING count(s.sid)>= (select count(bid) from Boats)
<sname>(COUNT(sid)>=4)(Sailors<sid=sid> ⋈ Reserves))



9.	Find the names of sailors who have reserved all boats called Interlake
10.	Find the names of sailors who have reserved at least two boats

<sname>(COUNT(sid)>=2)(Sailors<sid=sid> ⋈ Reserves))
